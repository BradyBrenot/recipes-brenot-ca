  steps:
  - Combine wafer crumbs and margarine.  Press onto bottom of a 9" springform pan.
  - Sprinkle gelatin over cold water in a small saucepan; let stand 1 minute. Stir
    over low heat until gelatin is completely dissolved - about 5 minutes.  Remove
    from heat.
  - Add 1/4 cup of gelatin mixture into the cherry pie filling.  Mix almond extract
    and 1/4 cup water together.  Stir 2 tsp of this into pie filling.  Pour cherry
    mixture over crust and refrigerate until set - about 30 minutes.
  - Beat cream cheese and sugar together  until light and fluffy; stir in sour cream.  Add
    remaining gelatin mixture and almond extract mixture.  Fold in whipped cream;
    spread over cherry base.  Refrigerate until set - about 4 hours or overnight.
  - Remove side of pan from cheesecake and garnish with chocolate shavings and cherry
    pie filling.
notes:
- Instead of almond extract and water, you may use 1/3 cup almond flavoured liqueur.

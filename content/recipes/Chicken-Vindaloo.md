directions:
- // Onion sauce //
- Pour enough vegetable oil into a frying pan to cover the base, with a little excess.
- Heat oil. Slice onions into thin slivers. When the oil is hot, add the onions.
- Turn the stove down to gently sauté the onions. Cook until they begin to caramelize,
  about 3 minutes.
- Gradually increase heat, continue stirring. Brown the onions heavily without burning
  them.
- Add the white wine vinegar, keeping in mind that it will sizzle. Continue stirring.
  Fry until the onions are very browned and near to (but not yet) burning.
- Remove the onions into a bowl, keeping as much oil in the pan as possible.
- Add onions to a blender or food processor. Add 1 tbsp oil, process until a thick,
  brown sauce.
- Set sauce aside.
- // Garlic/chili paste //
- Coarsely chop the garlic, ginger, and peppers. Add to the food processor, blender,
  or a coffee grinder (or a food processor with a coffee grinder attachment). This
  may be difficult in a normal blender due to the dryness and volume of the mixture;
  if so, a small amount of water may help.
- Blend until the mixture becomes a fairly grainy, but liquid, paste. Place in a bowl.
- Add turmeric, coriander, garam masala, and cinnamon to the paste. Stir.
- Crush or grind black pepper corns. Add mustard seed and rock salt. Mix. Add to paste.
  Stir, and set paste aside.
- // Cooking //
- Pour a small amount of oil into a saucepan. Heat on medium-highish. Add paste into
  pan, spread out well.
- When sauce is bubbling, add meat. Stir to ensure that meat absorbs paste. Cook until
  browned.
- Add onion sauce. Stir for 1 minute. Add water, stir for 2 minutes. Turn heat to
  fairly low.
- Add vegetables if desired.
- Simmer, covered, for 30-40 minutes. Check and stir every 5 to 10 minutes to prevent
  sticking.
- Serve over rice. Sprinkle with chopped fresh coriander leaves.
notes:
- Choose chili peppers based on the heat you're looking for. E.g. jalapeños result
  in a fairly mild vindaloo, habaneros make it extremely hot.

  steps:
  - Preheat oven to 425 F
  - Clean squash. Cut squash in half. Place pieces on foil-lined baking sheet, with
    cut sides facing up. Brush with 1 tbsp butter or oil. Season with salt and pepper.
    Roast until tender, about an hour.
  - Peel, core, cut the apple. Cook onion, apple, and sage in a dutch oven over medium
    heat. Add other vegetables if desired; a few carrots and celery stalks will work
    well. Cook until onions and apples are softened, then set aside until squash is
    ready.
  - Cool squash on a wire rack. When it's cool enough to work with, scoop flesh out
    into the dutch oven.
  - Add broth, water, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil at medium-high heat, break
    up the squash, and simmer on medium-low for about 15 minutes.
  - Stir in the coconut milk
  - Blend with an immersion blender until smooth.
  - Taste, add salt and pepper as desired.
notes:
- |-
  Try adding in some curry powder to make give the soup a bit of something extra.

  * Alternatively, do as the recipe's source does and use 1/3 cup heavy cream, increasing water to 2 1/2 cups.

ingredients:
- Ingredients:
  - Whole butternut squash (about 1 large or 2 medium): 4 lbs
  - butter or oil: 2 tbsp
  - granny smith apple: "1"
  - medium yellow onion: 1/2
  - other vegetables: ""
  - fresh sage leaves: "8"
  - vegetable or chicken broth: 2 1/2 cups

directions:
- Preheat oven to 425 F
- Clean squash. Cut squash in half. Place pieces on foil-lined baking sheet, with
  cut sides facing up. Brush with 1 tbsp butter or oil. Season with salt and pepper.
  Roast until tender, about an hour.
- Peel, core, cut the apple. Cook onion, apple, and sage in a dutch oven over medium
  heat. Add other vegetables if desired; a few carrots and celery stalks will work
  well. Cook until onions and apples are softened, then set aside until squash is
  ready.
- Cool squash on a wire rack. When it's cool enough to work with, scoop flesh out
  into the dutch oven.
- Add broth, water, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil at medium-high heat, break up
  the squash, and simmer on medium-low for about 15 minutes.
- Stir in the coconut milk
- Blend with an immersion blender until smooth.
- Taste, add salt and pepper as desired.
notes:
- |-
  Try adding in some curry powder to make give the soup a bit of something extra.

  * Alternatively, do as the recipe's source does and use 1/3 cup heavy cream, increasing water to 2 1/2 cups.

    steps:
      - Mix ingredients
      - Marinate chicken for at least 1 hour
notes:
  - Gï»¿ochujang and gochugaru can be found in any korean grocery store (or store
    with korean foods).
  - I've mixed the leftover marinade with some chicken broth and made soup out of it. You could also cook it down (with some water if necessary) to make a sauce. Don't waste it!

This gochugaru marinade works great for grilled chicken, but you can also pan fry, roast, or air fry it. Portioned for about 1 pound of boneless chicken.

  * You can omit the stir frying step if time is an issue.

  ** Sew the cardamom pods together, or wrap in a cheese cloth bundle to make removal easier. Could also put them in a tea bag or infuser. Or, just use the ground stuff instead.

  *** The source recommends "Patak's mild curry paste," which is usually available at Superstore/Loblaws alongside the other Indian foods. You want an Indian curry paste, not a Thai one.

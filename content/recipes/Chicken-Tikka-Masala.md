  steps:
  - Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces. Combine first set of ingredients (yogurt,
    lemon juice, garam masala, cumin, turmeric, cayenne, black pepper, ginger, and
    salt) in a bowl. Mix in chicken. Marinate overnight, or at least one hour.
  - Preheat grill for medium-high (450F for an oven). Place chicken on skewers.
  - Oil the grill. Grill chicken until juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side
    (or in the oven, place the skewers in/over a roasting or drip pan, and cook until
    it's done, about 10-15 minutes). Be aware that it may stick.
  - Melt butter at medium heat. Saute garlic, chili, and onion for one minute. Add
    spices (cumin, paprika, garam masala, salt). Stir in tomato sauce and coconut
    milk. Once simmering, reduce temperature and simmer until thickened, about 20
    minutes. Add in the cooked chicken, simmer another 10 minutes. Serve.

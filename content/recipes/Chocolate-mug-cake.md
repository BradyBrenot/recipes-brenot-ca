  steps:
  - Add dry ingredients to mug and mix.
  - Add wet ingredients, mix.
  - Microwave on high for up to 3 minutes (may take some experimentation)
notes:
- 'Variation #1 is less a ''cake'' and more a ''brownie''. It requires more careful microwave timing;
  2 minutes 30 seconds seems to work f700 watt microwave.'

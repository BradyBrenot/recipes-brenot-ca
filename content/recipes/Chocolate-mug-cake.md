ingredients:
- Ingredients:
  - flour: 1/4 cup (4tbsp)
  - sugar: 1/4 cup
  - cocoa: 2 tbsp
  - cinnamon: pinch
  - egg: "1"
  - milk: 3 tbsp
  - vegetable oil: 3 tbsp
  - vanilla extract: splash
  - large coffee mug: "1"
- 'Variation #1 (no egg)':
  - flour: 1/4 cup
  - sugar: 1/4 cup
  - cocoa: 2 tbsp
  - salt: pinch
  - cinnamon: pinch
  - milk: 1/4 cup
  - vegetable oil: 2 tbsp
  - vanilla extract: splash
  - large coffee mug: "1"
directions:
- Add dry ingredients to mug and mix.
- Add wet ingredients, mix.
- Microwave on high for up to 3 minutes (may take some experimentation)
notes:
- 'Variation #1 is less a ''cake'' and more a ''brownie''; while it lacks the structure
  from the egg, it also lacks the salmonella. It requires more careful microwave timing;
  2 minutes 30 seconds seems to work for my 700 watt microwave.'

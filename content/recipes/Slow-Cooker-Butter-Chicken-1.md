ingredients:
- diced onions: "2"
- cloves of garlic, minced: "3"
- butter: 3 tbsp
- grated fresh ginger: 2 tbsp
- packed brown sugar: 2 tbsp

- 796 mL can diced tomatoes: "1"
- cup chicken broth: "1"
- almond or cashew butter: 1/4 cup
- boneless, skinless chicken thighs, quartered: 3 lbs
- plain yogurt (*or substitute heavy or sour cream): 1 cup
- chopped fresh cilantro: 2 tbsp
directions:
- Add onions, garlic, butter, ginger, brown sugar, chili powder, coriander, turmeric,
  cinnamon, cumin, salt, pepper, and tomatoes to slow cooker.
- Whisk broth with cashew/almond butter. Pour into slow cooker with the other ingredients
- Cook on low for 5 to 8 hours
- Pur√©e ingredients with an immersion blender.
- Add chicken, cook on high until chicken is cooked through and reaches a safe temperature;
  depending on the slow cooker, this could take anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours.
  Test the chicken's temperature, especially if it's your first time doing the recipe.
- Stir in yogurt.
- Optionally, sprinkle with fresh cilantro before serving.
notes:
- If your slow cooker takes substantially longer than 45 minutes to cook the chicken
  through on High, I'd be concerned about ever using it on Low with meat.

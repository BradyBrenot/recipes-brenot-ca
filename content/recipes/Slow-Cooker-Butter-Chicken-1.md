  steps:
  - Add onions, garlic, butter, ginger, brown sugar, chili powder, coriander, turmeric,
    cinnamon, cumin, salt, pepper, and tomatoes to slow cooker.
  - Whisk broth with cashew/almond butter. Pour into slow cooker with the other ingredients
  - Cook on low for 5 to 8 hours
  - Pur√©e ingredients with an immersion blender.
  - Add chicken, cook on high until chicken is cooked through and reaches a safe temperature;
    depending on the slow cooker, this could take anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours.
    Test the chicken's temperature, especially if it's your first time doing the recipe.
  - Stir in yogurt.
  - Optionally, sprinkle with fresh cilantro before serving.
notes:
- If your slow cooker takes substantially longer than 45 minutes to cook the chicken
  through on High, I'd be concerned about ever using it on Low with meat.

ingredients:
- Dough:
  - instant yeast: 9 g
  - warm water (105-115 F): 335 g
  - flour (bread or all-purpose): 450 g
  - salt: 9 g
  - extra virgin olive oil: 9 g
- For baking:
  - extra virgin olive oil: 20 g
  - water: 20 g
- Toppings (ideas):
  - whatever you want
  - tomatoes
  - olives
  - flaky salt
  - herbs
directions:
- Proof yeast: 
    - Add yeast to the warm water with a spoonful of the measured flour. Stir until dissolved, then let sit 5-10 minutes or until bubbles are visible.
- While yeast is proofing, add remaining flour and salt to a large bowl.
- When yeast has proofed, add to the bown and mix with hands until no dry flour is left on the bowl and dough sticks together. The dough will be very sticky.
- Pour olive oil over dough, work until oil is absorbed.
- Cover and let rest 20 minutes.
- Stretch and fold:
  - Take a corner of the dough, left as high as it will go without tearing, and fold it over the other side. Turn the bowl 90 degrees, and repeat 3 more times.
  - Turn the dough over onto itself, cover, and let rest 25-30 minutes.
  - Repeat the previous two steps 3 more times. The dough should be come more elastic each time.
- Proof:
    - Drizzle olive oil into a 9x13, turn dough into the pan and gently work to the edges. If dough springs back and won't stay on the edges, cover and rest for 15-20 minutes, then try again.
    - Cover and proof for 45-60 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 450F.
- Toppings:
    - Dimple the proofed dough with wet fingers, gently pushing down to the bottom of the pan without puncturing the dough. Perform 2-3 passes.
    - Wisk olive oil and water together with a fork until it emulsifies (2-3 minutes). Pour over dough.
    - Sprinkle other toppings; flaky salt, herbs, etc. (Tomatoes or olives should be pressed into the dough slightly)
- Bake, middle rack, 450F, 20-25 minutes until golden on top
- Let rest on a rack until a cloth for 5 minutes before serving

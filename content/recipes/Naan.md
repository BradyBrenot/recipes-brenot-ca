ingredients:
- active dry yeast (1 pkg): 2 1/4 tsp
- water: 1 cup
- baking soda: 1/2 tsp
- white sugar: 1/4 cup
- milk: 3 tbsp
- egg: "1"
- salt: 2 tsp
- bread flour: 3 1/2 cups
- minced garlic (optional): 2 tsp
- melted butter: 1/4 cup
directions:
- In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water with a tablespoon of sugar. Let stand
  10 minutes, until frothy.
- Stir in remaining sugar, milk, egg, salt, baking soda, and only enough flour as
  is needed to make for a soft dough (likely 3.5 cups, possibly up to 4.5). Knead
  on a lightly floured surface until smooth, about 6 to 8 minutes.
- Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and set aside to rise. Let
  rise 1 hour, dough should roughly double in volume.
- Punch down dough, knead in garlic if desired. Pinch off small, roughly golf ball-sized
  pieces. Roll into balls, and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow dough
  to rise until again roughly doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
- Brush or spray grill with canola oil to prevent sticking. Preheat to high.
- Roll dough balls into circles; pinch in half, and flatten again. Naan will cook
  substantially better if it's very thin.
- Place dough circle on grill; cook 2 to 3 minutes or until puffy and lightly browned.
  Brush uncooked side with melted butter. Turn. Brush cooked side with melted butter.
  Cook another 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from grill. Continue for all dough pieces until
  done.
notes:
- |-
  You'll probably only need about 3 1/4 cups of flour. A bread machine can do a lot of the work, but if doing so only use that much flour.

  To aid with the rising, put the dough bowl on the top rack of a cool oven, and a bowl of hot water on the lower rack.

  Bread flour will work best, however I've done this with all-purpose and it's still turned out nicely.

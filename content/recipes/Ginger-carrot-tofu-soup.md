  steps:
  - Press tofu (cut into slices, sit it between two towels, and set something heavy
    on top; leave for 30 minutes). Cube it. Marinate it in the describe marinade.
  - Meanwhile, heat oil at medium heat. Add vegetables, cook until just becoming soft,
    about five minutes. Add five-spice, carrot juice, stock, and water. Season with
    salt and pepper to taste, then simmer until tender (about 20 minutes).
  - Dry the tofu. Mix corn starch and curry powder, then coat the tofu with it. Over
    high heat, shallow fry tofu in batches until crispy.
  - After soup is done simmering, blend with an immersion blender (or carefully add
    to a normal blender and blend in batches). Ladle into bowls and top with the fried
    tofu.
notes:
- '* Marinade is work in progress. The dish is fine without, but the tofu is flavorless
  since it has no time to absorb the flavors from the soup.'

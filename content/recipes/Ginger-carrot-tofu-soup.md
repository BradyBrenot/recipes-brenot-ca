ingredients:
- Ingredients:
  - frozen carrots: 1 lbs
  - small onion: "1"
  - 2 to 3 inch piece of fresh ginger: "1"
  - five-spice powder: 1/2 tsp
  - carrot juice: 2 cups
  - tofu (medium or firm): 1 lbs
  - corn starch: 1/2 cup
  - curry powder: 1.5 tbsp
  - chicken or vegetable stock: 1 cup
  - water: 2 cups
- Marinade *:
  - grated ginger: 3 inch cube
  - soy sauce: 2 tbsp
  - lemon juice: 1 tbsp
  - curry powder: 1 tbsp
  - garlic powder: 1 tbsp
directions:
- Press tofu (cut into slices, sit it between two towels, and set something heavy
  on top; leave for 30 minutes). Cube it. Marinate it in the describe marinade.
- Meanwhile, heat oil at medium heat. Add vegetables, cook until just becoming soft,
  about five minutes. Add five-spice, carrot juice, stock, and water. Season with
  salt and pepper to taste, then simmer until tender (about 20 minutes).
- Dry the tofu. Mix corn starch and curry powder, then coat the tofu with it. Over
  high heat, shallow fry tofu in batches until crispy.
- After soup is done simmering, blend with an immersion blender (or carefully add
  to a normal blender and blend in batches). Ladle into bowls and top with the fried
  tofu.
notes:
- '* Marinade is work in progress. The dish is fine without, but the tofu is flavorless
  since it has no time to absorb the flavors from the soup.'

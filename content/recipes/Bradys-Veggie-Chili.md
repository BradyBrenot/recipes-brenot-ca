ingredients:
- Ingredients:
  - medium-large yellow onions, roughly chopped: "2"
  - medium tomatoes, quartered or eighthed *: "6"
  - bell or other sweet chili peppers, roughly chopped: 6 to 8
  - soft and medium tofu **: 1 to 2 lbs
  - head of garlic, diced: "1"
  - beans (kidney beans or chickpeas recommended): 2 cans
  - habanero, serrano, or other spicy chili: to taste / omit
  - (if necessary for thickening) tomato paste: 1/4 to 1/2 can
- Spices:
  - chili powder ***: 2 to 6 tbsp
  - spicy chili powder (e.g. cayenne or chipotle): to taste / omit
  - ground cumin seed: 2 tsp
  - ground coriander seed: 2 tsp
  - ground black pepper (or to taste): 1 tsp
  - curry powder: 1.5 tsp
  - onion powder: 1 tsp
  - chicken bouillon, stock concentrate, etc. †: 1.5 tsp
directions:
- Heat oil or melt butter in pot.†† Add onions, chili peppers, and garlic. Saute over
  medium-high until onions start caramelizing.
- Add tomatoes, spices, and chicken bouillon. Stir. Saute for another five minutes
  or so. Tomatoes will start to release their liquid.
- Add beans, tofu. Stir. Reduce heat to medium and let begin to cook down.
- Taste, adjust if necessary.
- Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to simmer uncovered until the desired thickness
  has nearly been achieved (probably at least 30 minutes, or possibly not until you're
  done cooking anyways), then cover, reduce to just high enough to simmer, and continue
  simmering for at least 30 minutes. Periodically stir, and taste test / adjust spices
  if necessary.
notes:
- |-
  * depending on the tomatoes and their sweetness and liquid content, you may want to dial this (and the tomato paste) up or down

  ** I like adding both soft and medium tofu; the soft tofu turns to mush (resembling ground meat visually, but not in mouthfeel), while the medium tofu somewhat keeps its shape. You really don't need to bother pressing the medium tofu, but you can if you want it to keep its shape better and possibly soak up the chili better. You can also substitute in the same weight of your preferred ground meat.

  *** No Name Brand chili powder is good, smokey, and spicy

  † I don't say "chicken stock" because this recipe already inherently includes a lot of liquid from the vegetables and the tofu, so if using bouillon or concentrate, just add it directly. Replace with vegetable stock or simply leave this out for a pure vegetarian variant.

  †† I prefer not to do this one in the slow cooker, it seems to develop better at higher temperatures. Your mileage may vary. You may have too much liquid if you do this in the slow cooker as-written because of the tofu and tomatoes, so maybe omit some tomatoes and add more tomato paste to compensate.

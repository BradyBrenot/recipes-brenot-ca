  steps:
  - Heat oil or melt butter in pot.†† Add onions, chili peppers, and garlic. Saute
    over medium-high until onions start caramelizing.
  - Add tomatoes, spices, and chicken bouillon. Stir. Saute for another five minutes
    or so. Tomatoes will start to release their liquid.
  - Add beans, tofu. Stir. Reduce heat to medium and let begin to cook down.
  - Taste, adjust if necessary.
  - Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to simmer uncovered until the desired thickness
    has nearly been achieved (probably at least 30 minutes, or possibly not until
    you're done cooking anyways), then cover, reduce to just high enough to simmer,
    and continue simmering for at least 30 minutes. Periodically stir, and taste test
    / adjust spices if necessary.
notes:
- |-
  * depending on the tomatoes and their sweetness and liquid content, you may want to dial this (and the tomato paste) up or down

  ** I like adding both soft and medium tofu; the soft tofu turns to mush (resembling ground meat visually, but not in mouthfeel), while the medium tofu somewhat keeps its shape. You really don't need to bother pressing the medium tofu, but you can if you want it to keep its shape better and possibly soak up the chili better. You can also substitute in the same weight of your preferred ground meat.

  *** No Name Brand chili powder is good, smokey, and spicy

  † I don't say "chicken stock" because this recipe already inherently includes a lot of liquid from the vegetables and the tofu, so if using bouillon or concentrate, just add it directly. Replace with vegetable stock or simply leave this out for a pure vegetarian variant.

  †† I prefer not to do this one in the slow cooker, it seems to develop better at higher temperatures. Your mileage may vary. You may have too much liquid if you do this in the slow cooker as-written because of the tofu and tomatoes, so maybe omit some tomatoes and add more tomato paste to compensate.

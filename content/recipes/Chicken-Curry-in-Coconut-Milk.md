  steps:
  - Heat oil in a large frying pan or wok. Add onion, and simmer until translucent.
  - Add curry powder, garam masala, ginger, garlic powder, and stir for one minute.
  - Add chicken and water, stirring and scraping until meat is heated and spices mixed.
  - Shake coconut milk can, open and add to pan, mix well (canned coconut milk separates).
  - Add remaining ingredients. Simmer for 15 minutes, thickening with additional tomato
    paste and adding additional spices if desired.
  - Serve over rice.
notes:
- Unless you use exceedingly spicy curry powder or garam masala, this curry is very
  mild as it's written. If more heat is desired, add in some chili powder or a nice
  hot sauce; you may also want to bring up the amount of garam masala and curry powder.

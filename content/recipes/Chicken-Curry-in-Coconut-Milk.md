- Ingredients:
  - cubed cooked chicken (~2 large breasts): 2 cups

  - vegetable oil: 4 tbsp
  - curry powder: 2 tsp
  - garlic powder: 1/2 tsp
  - ground ginger: 1 tsp
  - garam masala: 2 tsp
  - water: 1/2 cup

  - sugar: 2 tsp
  - salt: 1/4 tsp
  - tomato paste: 6 tbsp
- Accompaniment:
  - small servings of rice: "4"
  - naan or other bread: ""
directions:
- Heat oil in a large frying pan or wok. Add onion, and simmer until translucent.
- Add curry powder, garam masala, ginger, garlic powder, and stir for one minute.
- Add chicken and water, stirring and scraping until meat is heated and spices mixed.
- Shake coconut milk can, open and add to pan, mix well (canned coconut milk separates).
- Add remaining ingredients. Simmer for 15 minutes, thickening with additional tomato
  paste and adding additional spices if desired.

notes:
- Unless you use exceedingly spicy curry powder or garam masala, this curry is very
  mild as it's written. If more heat is desired, add in some chili powder or a nice
  hot sauce; you may also want to bring up the amount of garam masala and curry powder.

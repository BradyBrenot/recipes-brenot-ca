  - cinnamon stick (or 1 tsp ground): "1"
  - whole coriander seed (or 1 tsp ground): 3 tsp
  - ground turmeric: 2 tsp
- Remaining wet masala mix:
  - white wine vinegar: 2 tbsp
  - medium yellow onions, roughly chopped: "2"
  - serrano pepper, seeded and rougly chopped: "1"
  - brown sugar: 1 tsp
- Ginger/garlic paste:
  - fresh ginger: 1 inch cube
  - garlic: 1/2 head
- The rest:
  - medium, diced tomatoes: "2"
  - cubed chicken, lamb, or tofu*: 1.5 lbs
  - (optional) medium potatoes (or sweet potatoes): "2"
  - (optional) chopped bell pepper: "1"
  - for serving (e.g. basmati rice, chapati, or naan): rice or bread
directions:
- WORK IN PROGRESS, especially the ingredient list
- Toast the whole spices (the cumin seed, cinnamon, peppercorns, coriander seed, and
  mustard seed) until aromatic, about 1 minute. Then, add them and the remainder of
  the spice mix to spice grinder and process until smooth.
- Add onions, serrano, and oil to the pan. Over medium heat, cook onions until they
  begin to brown, then add vinegar (watch the sizzling!). Continue to cook until the
  onions are very brown but not burnt.
- Place onions in food processor (attempting to reserve the oil in the pan) or if
  necessary, a blender. Add spice mix and brown sugar. Process until a paste.
- Put the onion/spice base ("wet masala") in a bowl to reserve until later. Add the
  ginger and garlic to the food processor and process until a paste. Add a small amount
  of water if necessary.
- Heat pan at medium-high heat. Add ginger/garlic paste to the pan and stir while
  cooking until it starts to brown.
- Add the wet masala to the pan and quickly stir to mix with the ginger/garlic paste.
  Continue stirring. Once the mix starts bubbling, add the meat (and optionally, bell
  pepper) and cook until browned.
- Add tomatoes. Add 1 cup of water to food proccessor bowl or blender jar, swirl it
  around a bit to get any remaining paste out of there, and add it to the dish. Add
  salt and additional pepper to taste.
- Cover and simmer for 40 minutes.
- 'Optionally: cut up two (sweet) potatoes. Boil until slightly soft, about 10-15
  minutes, then add them to the simmering curry for at least 15 minutes.'
notes:
- |-
  * tofu is going to turn to mush. You should:

  A) Use a medium, firm, or extra-firm tofu. Soft will completely vanish.
  B) Press it.
  C) If you want to go further: Cube it, coat it in a curry powder / corn starch mix, then shallow fry or deep fry it.

  You should also marinate it if you're going to pre-fry it (and possibly even if not). Double the wet masala spice mix, using half to marinate the tofu along with white wine vinegar and vegetable or chicken stock.

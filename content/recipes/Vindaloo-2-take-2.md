  steps:
  - WORK IN PROGRESS, especially the ingredient list
  - Toast the whole spices (the cumin seed, cinnamon, peppercorns, coriander seed,
    and mustard seed) until aromatic, about 1 minute. Then, add them and the remainder
    of the spice mix to spice grinder and process until smooth.
  - Add onions, serrano, and oil to the pan. Over medium heat, cook onions until they
    begin to brown, then add vinegar (watch the sizzling!). Continue to cook until
    the onions are very brown but not burnt.
  - Place onions in food processor (attempting to reserve the oil in the pan) or if
    necessary, a blender. Add spice mix and brown sugar. Process until a paste.
  - Put the onion/spice base ("wet masala") in a bowl to reserve until later. Add
    the ginger and garlic to the food processor and process until a paste. Add a small
    amount of water if necessary.
  - Heat pan at medium-high heat. Add ginger/garlic paste to the pan and stir while
    cooking until it starts to brown.
  - Add the wet masala to the pan and quickly stir to mix with the ginger/garlic paste.
    Continue stirring. Once the mix starts bubbling, add the meat (and optionally,
    bell pepper) and cook until browned.
  - Add tomatoes. Add 1 cup of water to food proccessor bowl or blender jar, swirl
    it around a bit to get any remaining paste out of there, and add it to the dish.
    Add salt and additional pepper to taste.
  - Cover and simmer for 40 minutes.
  - 'Optionally: cut up two (sweet) potatoes. Boil until slightly soft, about 10-15
    minutes, then add them to the simmering curry for at least 15 minutes.'
notes:
- |-
  * tofu is going to turn to mush. You should:

  A) Use a medium, firm, or extra-firm tofu. Soft will completely vanish.
  B) Press it.
  C) If you want to go further: Cube it, coat it in a curry powder / corn starch mix, then shallow fry or deep fry it.

  You should also marinate it if you're going to pre-fry it (and possibly even if not). Double the wet masala spice mix, using half to marinate the tofu along with white wine vinegar and vegetable or chicken stock.

  steps:
  - Lightly grease muffin cups.
  - Grate cheese, set aside.
  - Stir together flour, salt and cayenne.
  - Beat eggs, milk and butter together.
  - 'Make a well in dry ingredients and add egg mixture.  Beat until smooth.  '
  - 'Spoon about 1 Tbsp batter into each muffin cup.  Srpinkle with 1 Tbsp cheese.  Alternate
    batter and cheese until both are used up and cups are half filled.  '
  - 'Bake for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350 and continue baking for 15 - 20 minutes.  '
notes:
- If not baked long enough, popovers will collapse.  The best way to check for doneness
  is to remove a popover to see if the outside walls are firms.

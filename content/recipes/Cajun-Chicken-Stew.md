  steps:
  - Heat 3 tbsp oil over fairly high heat. Pat chicken dry, sprinkle with salt. Brown
    chicken in 4 batches, about 5 minutes a batch, transferring to a bowl when done.
  - To make the roux, add 1/2 cup oil to a pot, and stir in 1/2 cup flour. Cook over
    moderately low heat, using a flat metal or wooden spatula to scrape (not stir)
    back and forth constantly to ensure roux doesn't burn. Cook until roux is a milk
    chocolate colour, 10 to 20 minutes.
  - Add onion, bell pepper, and celery. Cook, occasionally scraping, until onion is
    softened, about 8 minutes.
  - Add water to mixture, bring to a boil. Stir occasionally until roux is incorporated.
  - Add chicken and any juices accumulated in bowl. Simmer, partially covered, until
    chicken is fully cooked, 30 to 35 minutes. Stir in cayenne, scallion greens, and
    salt to taste.
  - Serve over rice.
notes:
- Switch some or all of the water for chicken stock, and/or add in a cajun seasoning
  mix for more a punchy flavour.

- Accompaniment:
  - white rice: ""
directions:
- Heat 3 tbsp oil over fairly high heat. Pat chicken dry, sprinkle with salt. Brown
  chicken in 4 batches, about 5 minutes a batch, transferring to a bowl when done.
- To make the roux, add 1/2 cup oil to a pot, and stir in 1/2 cup flour. Cook over
  moderately low heat, using a flat metal or wooden spatula to scrape (not stir) back
  and forth constantly to ensure roux doesn't burn. Cook until roux is a milk chocolate
  colour, 10 to 20 minutes.
- Add onion, bell pepper, and celery. Cook, occasionally scraping, until onion is
  softened, about 8 minutes.
- Add water to mixture, bring to a boil. Stir occasionally until roux is incorporated.
- Add chicken and any juices accumulated in bowl. Simmer, partially covered, until
  chicken is fully cooked, 30 to 35 minutes. Stir in cayenne, scallion greens, and
  salt to taste.
- Serve over rice.
notes:
- Switch some or all of the water for chicken stock, and/or add in a cajun seasoning
  mix for more a punchy flavour.

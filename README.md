# recipes-brenot-ca
This is used to build [recipes.brenot.ca](https://recipes.brenot.ca).

This is a family recipes site built using Hugo, using the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) theme as a starting point.

[NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) is used as a CMS to allow for _more or less_ mom-friendly editing.

If this eventually matures to the point where I'd want to share it, I'll probably split all the theme stuff out into another repo to make to more publishable.
